        I am a tech enthusiast. I had my pure interst in this field since my childhood, but was unable to learn much due to lack of opputunities in my school.<br>
        I started my tech journey after coming to this university and by now I have acquired some very basic skills on programming and web development.<br>
        I have come to realise that opencode is the perfect platform for me where I can learn lots of new stuff by interacting and collaborating with peoples round the globe.
